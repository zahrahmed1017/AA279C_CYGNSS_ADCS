function attitude = PropagateAttitude_Quat(w, M_vec, I_p, q)

% Not sure if I can actually do it this way.....was trying to just make one
% equation to propagate the dynamics (Euler) and then kinematics
% (w quaternions) in one function. But we need to integrate the dynamics at
% every time step and pass that to kinematics?
